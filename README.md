# **Ansible Project for Network Configuration and Services Deployment**

## Overview
This Ansible project automates the configuration of a network including a:
```
Gateway VM
DNS VM
DHCP VM
web server VM
```
The playbooks facilitate the setup of these virtual machines in ***vSphere***.

## Prerequisites 
This project assumes you have the following: 
```
- Access to a vSphere environment
- Necessary permissions for VM management and configuration
- Have Python3.X Installed
```

## Step One
Change your directory to where you wish to run this script and store the cloned repository:
```
cd <filename>
```

## Step Two
Clone the repository from github and then you can set your python virtual environment
```
git clone https://github.com/laurawarren88/ansible_vm.git
```

## Step Three 
Now you have the repository stored where you want it you can set your python virtual environment and install all the necessary requirments
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step Four 
Take a look around the file structure and see what is happening. 
You will need to add a secrets file into the file tree to store necessary information to run the playbook. 
I'll walk you through it:
```
touch roles/vars/secrets.yml
vim roles/vars/secrets.yml
```

In the file you need to include your information into the following variables:
```
vars_vcenter_username: ""
vars_vcenter_password: ""
vars_folder_path: ""
vars_internal_network: ""
```

Inbetween the double quotes store your username and password you use to login to vSphere. 
For the folder path list a location where you want the VMs to store in vSphere e.g. "/Development/vm"
For the internal network list the name of a VM network you want to use for the internal network to connect to. 
Once you have these set make sure you save the file and encrypt it, remember the password you set you'll need it later ðŸ˜œ. 
```
ansible-vault encrypt roles/vars/secrets.yml
```

## Playbooks

### DNS Server Configuration
The DNS server is configured to handle domain resolution. The playbook installs BIND, sets up the necessary configuration files, and ensures the service is running.

â€¢	Playbook Path: playbooks/dns.yml

### DHCP Server Configuration
The DHCP server provides dynamic IP address allocation to devices in the network. This playbook installs the DHCP server software and configures it with the specified settings.

â€¢	Playbook Path: playbooks/dhcp.yml

### Web Server Deployment
The web server hosts the application from a specified GitHub repository.

â€¢	Playbook Path: playbooks/webserver.yml

## How to Use

2.  Modify the var/main.yml file as you see fit if you want to save the VMs in a new location.

    a.  (Make sure you use the template though as this has the updated mirrorlist and yum repository to deal with the depreciated CentOS)

3. The secrets file contains the username and password of the vSphere account. It also has the file location of the ssh private key to link to the already setup public key on the template from vSphere. 

4. Run the Playbook: ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml

    a. If using encrypted files, run the playbook with: ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yml --ask-vault-pass

5. Testing the Setup: curl http://<webserver_ip>:3000 | jq
